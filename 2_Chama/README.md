# CASE STUDY 2 -> Chama (Type : Data Formating )

Chama is a relatively new, modern company, with an IOS App and Android App. To grow our company we must make a special effort in collecting all information available around the App and make it available for everyone in the company. Some information about App usage is generated by our App and our backend API. Other sources of information, like the Google Play Store, can provide very useful insights on App performance and user rating. Chama is very data-oriented and, most decisions are made based on appropriate metrics, therefore, data quality is a must and a concern of everyone involved.
